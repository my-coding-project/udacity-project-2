I have created the dev for testing, and the main branch where I merge my update changes.

I have also created this note to point out my Elastic Beanstalk URL

Here is the url: 

# The Deployment URL
Deployment URL: http://testbeanstalk-env.eba-xctudcph.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

I also place the dashboard diagram in the deployment_screenshot directory with the name

Thank you.
